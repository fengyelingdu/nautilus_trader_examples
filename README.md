## Run / Development Setup

Any python package manager (conda, poetry, pyenv, virtualenv) will work with this project, but I can't recommend `uv` enough for the speed, reliability and comfort. It is really the best swiss-knife tool for:
- for installing python itself
- managing dependencies
- managing python environments

**How to use `uv` with repo above:**

1. One time `uv` installation: `https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/`
2. Download repo above
3. `cd nautilus_trader_examples` into the folder 
   * and run `uv sync` 
   * Note: this command reads file `pyproject.toml` containing python + all dependencies and installs them into newly created `.venv` folder
4. Activate your env: `source .venv/bin/activate`

You can also setup any IDE to refer to the `.venv` folder as Python environment, that you like (PyCharm, VSCode, ...)

To become better friend with `uv` tool, I can recommend:
* Great tutorial: https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/uv-deep-dive/   (great finding by @faysou)
* Quick reference: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/stefansimik/dev_guides/blob/main/uv/uv_quick_reference.html
* Official docs: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

## Contribution Guidelines  

Contributions are highly appreciated! ðŸš€ 

Feel free to submit pull requests and share your own examples to make this repository even better!

To maintain a high quality of examples, all contributions should meet the following criteria:  

1. **Minimalistic and focused:**  
   * Examples should ideally be as simple as possible and clearly demonstrate the usage of a single concept, feature or area of Nautilus Trader.
2. **Self-contained:**  
   * Each example (and its directory) must include all the necessary components â€” such as code and required data â€” to run the example independently. 
   * If possible try to reuse existing market data
3. **Well-documented:**  
   * Examples should include reasonable comments, especially in key parts of the code where the main concept or feature being demonstrated is highlighted.
